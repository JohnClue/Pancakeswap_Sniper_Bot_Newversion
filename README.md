Changelog v1

Recoded my uniswap bot to work with pancakeswap. This project was also made to fix bugs in the uniswap-bot, because the transaction fee's are so low.


Current bugs

Some tokens or trading amounts are not possible to trade with, due to this issue: ethereum/web3.py#1634 This is the error-message you get: "Python int too large to convert to C ssize_". If you get this error its best to exclude the token (which probably has a very low price per token) or trade with lower amounts.
Sloppy dinamic design of GUI
Sometimes lag when updating names or when starting the bot (0-10 seconds)
More: Let me know!



To do

Let the amount of decimals and the token-name be derived automatically (like in the uniswap-bot)
New, more user-friendly design
Fix "Python int too large to convert to C ssize_"
(Depends on whether the application is used)
